                        Milkha Singh was born on 20 November 1929. He was born in a Sikh family 
                        of Rathore Rajput origin. His birthplace was Govindpura, 
                        a village 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from Muzaffargarh city in Punjab Province, 
                        British India (now Muzaffargarh District, Pakistan).

                        Escaping the troubles in Punjab, where killings of Hindus and Sikhs were continuing,
                        by moving to Delhi, India, in 1947, Singh lived for a short time with the family of 
                        his married sister and was briefly imprisoned at Tihar jail for travelling on a train 
                        without a ticket. His sister, Ishvar, sold some jewellery to obtain his release.
                        He spent some time at a refugee camp in Purana Qila and at a resettlement colony in 
                        Shahdara, both in Delhi.

                        Milkha Singh joined the Indian Army in 1951, 4 years after he survived personal 
                        losses during the partition. Milkha Singh took to athletics during his Army stint and 
                        went on to become one of India's finest athletes.

                        Singh represented India in the 200m and 400m competitions of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Games.
                        His inexperience meant that he did not progress from the heat stages but a meeting with the eventual 
                        400m champion at those Games, Charles Jenkins, both inspired him to greater things and provided 
                        him with information about training methods.

                        When Milkha Singh took to the track at the 1958 Commonwealth Games in Cardiff 
                        most people had never heard of him. But he was to make history there and is now hailed 
                        as one of India's greatest athletes.
                        He then won a gold medal in the 400m (440 yards at this time) competition at the 1958 
                        British Empire and Commonwealth Games with a time of 46.6 seconds.

                        In 1958, Singh set records for the 200m and 400m in the National Games of India, held 
                        at Cuttack, and also won gold medals in the same events at the Asian Games.This
                        latter achievement made him the first gold medalist at the Commonwealth Games from independent India. 
                        Before Vikas Gowda won the gold in 2014, Milkha was the only Indian male to have won an individual 
                        athletics gold medal at those Games.

                        Milkha Singh went to the 1960 Rome Olympics as one of the world's pre-eminent 
                        male quarter-milers. The quartet of Otis Davis, Carl Kaufmann, Malcolm Spence 
                        and Singh—they finished in that order in the 400m final at the Games—was the best 
                        in business and Singh was separated from a podium finish by one-tenth of a second.

                        At the 1962 Asian Games, held in Jakarta, Singh won gold in the 400m and in the 4 x 400m relay. 
                        He attended the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, where he was entered to compete in the 400m, 
                        the 4 x 100m relay and the 4 x 400m relay. He did not take part in either the 400m or the 
                        4 x 100m relay[d] and the Indian team of Milkha Singh, Makhan Singh, Amrit Pal and Ajmer Singh 
                        were eliminated when they finished fourth in the heat stages of the 4 x 400m.

                        Singh was awarded the Padma Shri (one of India's highest civilian honours) in 1959. 
                        After his retirement he served as the director of sports in Punjab.

                        In 2001, he turned down an offer of the Arjuna Award from the Indian government, 
                        arguing that it was intended to recognise young sports people and not those such as him. 
                        He also thought that the Award was being inappropriately given to people who had little 
                        notable involvement as active sports people at all. He said that "I have been clubbed with 
                        sportspersons who are nowhere near the level that I had achieved" and that the award had 
                        become devalued.

                        Singh and his daughter, Sonia Sanwalka, co-wrote his autobiography, titled The Race of My Life. 
                        It was published in 2013. The book inspired Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, a 2013 biographical 
                        film of Singh's life

                        While sharing his experience in a college in Goa in 2014, he stated, 
                        "The awards nowadays are distributed like 'prasad' in a temple. Why should one 
                        be honoured when he or she has not achieved the benchmark for the award? I rejected the 
                        Arjuna I was offered after I received the Padma Shri. It was like being offered an SSC 
                        [secondary school] certificate after securing a Masters degree."

                        In September 2017, Singh's wax statue – created by sculptors of Madame Tussauds in 
                        London – was unveiled at Chandigarh. It depicts Singh in running posture during his 
                        victorious run at the 1958 Commonwealth Games.[40] The statue is placed at Madame Tussauds 
                        museum in New Delhi, India.

                        Singh was admitted to the intensive care unit at Fortis Hospital in Mohali on 24 May 2021 with 
                        pneumonia caused by COVID-19. His condition was, for a while, described as stable, but he died 
                        on 18 June 2021 at 11:30 pm in Chandigarh.[28] His wife, Nirmal Saini, had died a few days 
                        earlier on 13 June 2021, also due to COVID-19.
                        Singh was laid on his funeral pyre with a photo of his wife in his hands.
